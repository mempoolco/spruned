#### What's this?

<p>sPRUNED is a bitcoin client for light systems. <br />
256mb ram & 500mb hdd should be fairly enough to keep it up & running.
<br />

At this very moment it supports only bitcoin mainnet. Testnet support will come soon before beta release.<br /><br />
It's a replacement for bitcoind on lightweight systems (It's proven to work on a Raspberry Zero, along with CLightning), it provides an interface for bitcoin-cli. <br />
<br />

#### How it works?

spruned downloads and store the bitcoin blocks on demand, when you need them, directly from the Peer2Peer Bitcoin Network.<br/>
there's a "bootstrap" functionality, to keep the last ~200 (default settings) blocks on the local storage, because 
fetch blocks may require also up to 10 seconds with slow connections, and this "bootstrap mode" reduces latencies on usage.<br />

You can use bitcoin-cli, or any other RPC client, as if you had bitcoind up & running.<br />
For the transactions related APIs and utxo tracking, spruned uses the electrum network.

#### Documentation

* [Installation and usage on Raspberry Pi (Raspbian 9.3)](docs/rpi-b-2012.md)

#### Dependencies

spruned works with Python >= 3.5.3. Right now it should work only on Linux systems.<br />
<br />
It make intensive usage of connectrum, pybitcointools and pycoinnet libraries. Thanks to mantainers & contributors! <br />
Especially at this stage of development (but it would be better always), it is recommended to use virtualenv to run spruned.


#### Usage
Developers: I hope code is self explaining enough, if you're familiar with asyncio.<br />

Everyone else: You can get inspiration on how to install spruned taking a look at setup.sh but, if you're lucky enough, setup.sh itself will 
create a virtual environment and install spruned into it. 

Well, try this:
```
$ cd ~/src
$ sudo apt-get install livleveldb-dev python3-dev git virtualenv
$ git clone https://github.com/gdassori/spruned.git
$ cd spruned
$ ./setup.sh
$ venv/bin/python spruned.py --help

$ venv/bin/python spruned.py --help

usage: spruned.py [-h] [--rpcuser RPCUSER] [--rpcpassword RPCPASSWORD]
                  [--rpcport RPCPORT] [--rpcbind RPCBIND] [--datadir DATADIR]
                  [--daemon] [--keep-blocks KEEP_BLOCKS]
                  [--network {bitcoin.mainnet}] [--debug]
                  [--cache-size CACHE_SIZE]

A Bitcoin Lightweight Pseudonode

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --rpcuser RPCUSER     Username for JSON-RPC connections (default: rpcuser)
  --rpcpassword RPCPASSWORD
                        Password for JSON-RPC connections (default:
                        rpcpassword)
  --rpcport RPCPORT     Listen for JSON-RPC connections on <port> (default:
                        8332 or testnet: 18332) (default: 8332)
  --rpcbind RPCBIND     Bind to given address to listen for JSON-RPC
                        connections. (default: 127.0.0.1)
  --datadir DATADIR     Specify data directory (default: $HOME/.spruned)
  --daemon              Run in the background as a daemon and accept commands
                        (default: False)
  --keep-blocks KEEP_BLOCKS
  --network {bitcoin.mainnet}
  --debug               Enable debug mode (default: False)
  --cache-size CACHE_SIZE
                        Cache size (in megabytes) (default: False)

```

And, once you run spruned:

```
$ tail -f ~/.spruned/spruned.log # to see what's going on!
```

or check the status*:

```
$ bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo
{
  "mediantime": 1523387051,
  "blocks": 517579,
  "headers": 517579,
  "verificationprogress": 100,
  "chain": "main",

  "warning": "spruned v0.0.1. emulating bitcoind v0.16",
  "pruned": false
}
```

Download a block:
```
$ bitcoin-cli getblock `bitcoin-cli getblockhash 1`
{
  "bits": 486604799,
  "mediantime": 1231469665,
  "nextblockhash": "000000006a625f06636b8bb6ac7b960a8d03705d1ace08b1a19da3fdcc99ddbd",

  ],

```

Or a transaction:
```
$ bitcoin-cli getrawtransaction 0e3e2357e806b6cdb1f70b54c3a3a17b6714ee1f0e68bebb44a74b1efd512098

```
######* bitcoin-cli is not included
<br /><br />

##### Emulated APIs as in bitcoind 0.16:
```
- estimatefee
- estimatesmartfee
- getbestblockhash
- getblock [mode 0 and mode 1]
- getblockchaininfo
- getblockcount
- getblockhash
- getblockheader [ verbose \ non verbose ]
- getrawtransaction [ non verbose only ]
- gettxout
```

##### Work in progress:

```
- sendrawtransaction
- getrawtransaction [ verbose ]
- getmempoolinfo
- getrawmempool
```


#### Requirements
- An internet connection
- **less than 500mb of disk space :-)**
- Python >= 3.5.3


#### Limitations

- May reduce privacy: if you have the entire blockchain on your own, you have to tell no one what you're looking for.
- Not fast as a full node: internet download is slower than a read from disk.
- Doesn't relay and partecipate to the network (this may change).
- Very unstable!


#### Future development
 
- Full Tor support
- Mempool emulation
- Zeromq emulation
- Maintenance UI


##### Have fun with sPRUNED

Spruned is **plenty** of bugs, because I care of you and I don't what you to get bored.
To reduce the entropy and help to put some interim order into the universe, you can have fun
with spruned by fixing bugs and enhancing it with new features. You can bet this will help.
